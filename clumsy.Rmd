####To check if dishwasher is clumsy.
```{r}
s=c('d1','d2','d3','d4','d5')
s
```
####Equally likely
```{r}
p=replicate(5,1/5)
p
```
#with replacement for the sample
```{r}

}
```

```{r}
nsimulations=10000
simulatedData=replicate(nsimulations,simTrail())
```
####checks if breaking is more than 4
```{r}
checkEvent=function(data){
  if(sum(data=="d1")>=4){ #can also write as if(sum(simulatedData %in% c("d1"))>=1)
    return (1)
  }
    return(0)
}
  
```
####the person is clumsy because the probability of breaking is less. So the breaking is done by dishwasher-CLUMSY
```{r}
simulatedData
mean(apply(simulatedData,2,checkEvent)) #if 1 then row by row
```

```{r}
((choose(5,4)*choose(4,1)+1)/5^5)
```
